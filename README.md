# Optical Pickup Units for DLHM: OPU-DLHM

This repo contains all the suplementary info and files related to the published paper "Adapting a Blu-ray Optical Pickup Unit as a Digital Lensless Holographic Microscopy Point Source". The circuit schematics and boards and the bill of materials will be found on this repo. As well as the most of our developements the info contained in this repo can be used for teaching and research purposes.

## Folders descriptions: 

- The circuit info folder contains the schematic and board design used to electronic-control of the OPU PHR-803T, the designs where adapted and modified from the schematics [presented by the team of Prof. Hwu](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.8b00340).
- The bill of materials folder contains all the needed materials and some usefull .step CAD designs to incorporate the OPU in an standard 30 mm cage system.
